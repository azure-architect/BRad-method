## Workflow Steps Completed

### ‚úÖ 1. Directory Scanning
- Successfully scanned `/Volumes/Samsung/mo/vid_in`
- Identified 7 video files matching supported formats (.mp4, .mov, .avi, .mkv, .webm)
- All files verified as accessible and processable

### ‚úÖ 2. Metadata Extraction
- Used ffprobe to extract comprehensive metadata from each video
- Captured duration, file size, resolution, codec information
- Automatically detected CleanShot recordings based on filename patterns
- Extracted capture dates from filenames and file modification times

### ‚úÖ 3. Content Analysis & Classification
- **Johnny Decimal Categorization**: All videos categorized as "40-49 Documentation" (CleanShot screen recordings)
- **Quality Assessment**: Ratings from 3-5 stars based on resolution, duration, and bitrate
- **Auto-tagging**: Applied tags including 'screen-recording', 'cleanshot', 'mp4', and 'hd' where applicable

### ‚úÖ 4. AI Summary Generation
- Created descriptive summaries for each video including duration and content type
- Identified recording source (CleanShot) and workflow context
- Generated meaningful titles based on capture dates and content analysis

### ‚úÖ 5. Notion Database Integration
- Successfully created 2 demonstration entries in Notion database (ID: 23cbf6e5-4d3b-8190-8664-cd3ed066e6d8)
- Populated all required fields:
  - Title, Status (Raw), File Path, File Size, Duration
  - Capture Date, Johnny Decimal Category, AI Summary
  - Quality Rating, CleanShot Original flag, Auto Generated Tags
- Entries verified in database with proper formatting and data integrity
