operations:
  project_creation:
    steps:
      1. Validate project data against schema
      2. Check for duplicate project names
      3. Create project entry with all required properties
      4. Generate initial tasks based on project type
      5. Create project documentation note
      6. Return project ID and Notion URL

  task_management:
    steps:
      1. Link tasks to parent project
      2. Set up task dependencies if specified
      3. Assign to team members if provided
      4. Update project completion percentage
      5. Notify dependent tasks when completed

  synchronization:
    steps:
      1. Query all databases for recent changes
      2. Identify conflicts or inconsistencies
      3. Apply resolution rules for conflicts
      4. Update last sync timestamps
      5. Generate sync report

error_handling:
  connection_failure:
    - Retry connection with exponential backoff
    - Fall back to cached data if available
    - Report connection status to user
  
  rate_limiting:
    - Implement request queuing
    - Use batch operations where possible
    - Respect Notion API limits
  
  data_validation:
    - Check required properties before submission
    - Validate property types and formats
    - Provide clear error messages for fixes
    
  schema_validation_errors:
    - When sort property doesn't exist, query database schema first
    - Use MCP retrieve-a-database to get actual property names
    - Update internal schema knowledge based on API responses
    - Fall back to unsorted queries if sorting fails
    - Example: "Created" property doesn't exist, use "Dates" instead
    
  property_name_mismatches:
    - Always use exact property names from Notion (case-sensitive)
    - Handle spaces in property names correctly
    - Use property IDs when names are complex
    - Validate all property references before operations

integration_points:
  github_sync:
    - Update project status when repositories are created
    - Link GitHub issues to Notion tasks
    - Sync commit activity to task progress
  
  resource_allocation:
    - Update resource status when allocated
    - Link resources to projects in database
    - Track resource utilization metrics

  project_workflows:
    - Create initial task templates based on project type
    - Set up project milestones and timelines
    - Generate progress reports and dashboards
