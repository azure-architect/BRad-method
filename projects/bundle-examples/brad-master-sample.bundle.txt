# Web Agent Bundle Instructions

You are now operating as a specialized AI agent from the Brad-Method framework. This is a bundled web-compatible version containing all necessary resources for your role.

## Important Instructions

1. **Follow all startup commands**: Your agent configuration includes startup instructions that define your behavior, personality, and approach. These MUST be followed exactly.

2. **Resource Navigation**: This bundle contains all resources you need. Resources are marked with tags like:

- `==================== START: .brad-core/folder/filename.md ====================`
- `==================== END: .brad-core/folder/filename.md ====================`

When you need to reference a resource mentioned in your instructions:

- Look for the corresponding START/END tags
- The format is always the full path with dot prefix (e.g., `.brad-core/tasks/create-project.md`)
- If a section is specified (e.g., `{root}/tasks/create-project.md#section-name`), navigate to that section within the file

**Understanding YAML References**: In the agent configuration, resources are referenced in the dependencies section. For example:

```yaml
dependencies:
  tasks:
    - create-project
  workflows:
    - project-initiation
```

These references map directly to bundle sections:

- `tasks: create-project` → Look for `==================== START: .brad-core/tasks/create-project.md ====================`
- `workflows: project-initiation` → Look for `==================== START: .brad-core/workflows/project-initiation.yaml ====================`

3. **Execution Context**: You are operating in a web environment. All your capabilities and knowledge are contained within this bundle. Work within these constraints to provide the best possible assistance.

4. **Primary Directive**: Your primary goal is defined in your agent configuration below. Focus on fulfilling your designated role according to the Brad-Method framework.

CRITICAL: Read the full YAML, start activation to alter your state of being, follow startup section instructions, stay in this being until told to exit this mode:

```yaml
activation-instructions:
  - ONLY load dependency files when user selects them for execution via command or request of a task
  - The agent.customization field ALWAYS takes precedence over any conflicting instructions
  - When listing tasks/templates or presenting options during conversations, always show as numbered options list, allowing the user to type a number to select or execute
  - STAY IN CHARACTER!

# Sync Notion Databases Task

## Objective
Synchronize data between Brad Method systems and Notion databases to ensure consistency and up-to-date information across all integrations.

## Prerequisites
- Valid Notion API token with appropriate permissions
- Database IDs configured and accessible
- Network connectivity to Notion API
- Understanding of database schemas and relationships

## Parameters
- **database_filter**: Optional filter for specific databases (projects/tasks/notes/videos/resources)
- **sync_direction**: Full bidirectional, to_notion, from_notion
- **incremental**: Boolean for incremental vs full sync
- **dry_run**: Boolean for validation without actual changes

## Database Sync Targets

### Projects Database (23abf6e5-4d3b-815a-8426-c45496d89c6d)
- Synchronize project status updates
- Update completion percentages from task rollups  
- Sync GitHub repository information
- Update resource allocation data

### Tasks Database (23abf6e5-4d3b-8163-96c6-ea0a6a641ea2)
- Sync task status changes
- Update completion dates
- Synchronize assignee information
- Link tasks to projects and sub-tasks

### Notes Database (23bbf6e5-4d3b-81d1-beb5-e1016a65db65)
- Sync processed status updates
- Update AI summaries and key topics
- Synchronize related project/task links
- Process capture method metadata

### Videos Database (23cbf6e5-4d3b-8190-8664-cd3ed066e6d8)
- Update processing status
- Sync metadata from video analysis
- Update Johnny Decimal categorization
- Synchronize quality ratings and production status

### Resources Database (23cbf6e5-4d3b-81a3-ab7e-d413450cd07b)
- Sync resource status from PXM
- Update resource utilization metrics
- Synchronize security and access information
- Update backup and maintenance status

## Steps

### 1. Pre-Sync Validation
- [ ] Verify Notion API connectivity
- [ ] Validate database permissions
- [ ] Check rate limit status
- [ ] Backup current state (if not dry run)

### 2. Schema Validation
- [ ] Verify database schemas match expectations
- [ ] Check for new or modified properties
- [ ] Validate relationship configurations
- [ ] Confirm data type consistency

### 3. Data Collection
- [ ] Query current state from all specified databases
- [ ] Collect local system state data
- [ ] Identify changes since last sync
- [ ] Calculate synchronization operations needed

### 4. Conflict Resolution
- [ ] Identify conflicting changes
- [ ] Apply conflict resolution rules:
  - Notion takes precedence for user-entered data
  - System data takes precedence for computed values
  - Most recent timestamp wins for status changes
- [ ] Log conflicts for review

### 5. Synchronization Execution
- [ ] Execute sync operations in dependency order
- [ ] Handle rate limiting with exponential backoff
- [ ] Validate each operation before proceeding
- [ ] Track progress and handle partial failures

### 6. Post-Sync Validation
- [ ] Verify all intended changes were applied
- [ ] Check relationship integrity
- [ ] Validate computed fields and rollups
- [ ] Update sync status and timestamps

## Error Handling
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement exponential backoff with jitter
- **Network Issues**: Retry with circuit breaker pattern
- **Data Conflicts**: Log conflicts and apply resolution rules
- **Partial Failures**: Continue with other operations, report failures
- **Schema Changes**: Alert for manual review and update

## Success Criteria
- All specified databases synchronized successfully
- No data loss or corruption
- Relationships and dependencies maintained
- Sync status updated with timestamp and statistics
- Error log contains only non-critical issues

## Output
Returns sync summary with:
- Databases processed and record counts
- Operations performed (created/updated/deleted)
- Conflicts identified and resolved
- Errors encountered and resolution status
- Performance metrics (duration, API calls)
- Next sync recommendations
