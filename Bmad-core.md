  BMad System Core Components:

  1. Agent-Based Architecture
  - Multiple specialized agents (analyst, pm, po, architect, dev, qa, ux-expert, sm)
  - BMad Master agent that can execute any task without persona transformation
  - Workflow-driven agent sequences for different project types

  2. Structured Workflows
  - Greenfield vs Brownfield development paths
  - Full-stack, service, and UI-specific workflows
  - Sequential agent handoffs with validation gates

  3. Task & Template System
  - Reusable tasks (create-doc, shard-doc, execute-checklist, etc.)
  - Templates for various documents (PRD, architecture, stories, etc.)
  - Checklists for quality gates and validation

  4. Document Management
  - Sharded documentation approach for large documents
  - Version-controlled artifacts in docs/ folder
  - Epic and story-based development tracking

  5. Quality Controls
  - Product Owner validation checkpoints
  - QA review cycles
  - Checklist-driven validation
